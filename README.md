# Image_classifier using Deep Neural Networks.
Using Iris dataset created a classifier utilizing DNNs. This was a project for Udacity course. 

## Information:
This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

The HTML page provides the basic code required to load the data and display it on the page (as JSON) using D3.js.

For a more up to date code example with React & D3, see (VizHub: Stylized Scatter Plot)[https://vizhub.com/curran/3d631093c2334030a6b27fa979bb4a0d?edit=files&file=index.js].


## Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica
